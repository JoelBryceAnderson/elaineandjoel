      question: "What is the dress code?",
      answer: "The dress code is cocktail attire. For men, this means a suit or sports coat with dress pants. For women, this means a cocktail dress or an elegant pantsuit. The venue is indoors and temperature-controlled, but you may want to bring a light layer for comfort."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I bring a plus one?",
      answer: "Due to venue capacity limitations, we can only accommodate the guests named on your invitation. Your RSVP will indicate whether you have been invited with a guest."
    },
    {
      question: "Will there be parking available?",
      answer: "While there is some street parking available in the area, we recommend using ride-sharing services or public transportation. The venue is a 10-minute walk from the Bedford Ave L train station. If you're driving, there are several parking garages within a few blocks."
    },
    {
      question: "Are children welcome?",
      answer: "No children, please. Adults only."
    },
    {
      question: "What time should I arrive?",
      answer: "Doors open at the venue at 6:00 PM. The ceremony will begin promptly at 6:30 PM. We recommend arriving 15-20 minutes prior to the ceremony to allow time for seating. The cocktail hour will begin immediately following the ceremony."
    },
    {
      question: "Will the ceremony and reception be indoors or outdoors?",
      answer: "Both the ceremony and reception will be held indoors at Aurora Restaurant."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you have a wedding registry?",
      answer: "We are not registered. You can find links to donate to our honeymoon fund & local charities on the Registry & Gifts page. Please note that while we appreciate your generosity, gifts are not necessary. Most of you are traveling to celebrate the day with us and the time and effort you are putting into that is more than enough of a gift for us."
    },
    {
      question: "What's for dinner?",

    },
    {
      question: "Are there dietary restrictions I should know about?",
      answer: "The menu will include vegetarian options. If you have specific dietary restrictions or allergies, please note them in your RSVP response and we will do our best to accommodate you."

      question: "Will there be dancing?",
